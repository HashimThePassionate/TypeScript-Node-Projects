## About

This repository is a treasure of TypeScript-based Node CLI projects, each designed to showcase a different aspect of programming and problem-solving. Inside, you'll discover a diverse array of applications, including a calculator for mathematical tasks, a number guessing game that challenges your intuition, an ATM simulator for financial interactions, a to-do list manager for keeping your tasks organized, a currency converter for global financial conversions, a word counter to analyze text, a student management system for educational institutions, an adventure game to embark on exciting quests, a quiz app to test your knowledge, a countdown timer to keep track of time, a bank application for financial management, and an array of other fascinating creations. These projects are not only excellent learning resources but also serve as a testament to the versatility of TypeScript and Node.js in building real-world command-line applications.

## Features

1. **Interactive Command Line**: Use the `inquirer` library to create interactive command-line prompts, making it easy for users to input data and make selections within the CLI.
2. **Styling and Coloring**: Integrate `chalk` for adding colors and styles to text in the terminal, making your CLI tool visually appealing and easy to read.
3. **Command Line Argument Parsing**: Utilize libraries like `yargs` or TypeScript's built-in `process.argv` to parse command-line arguments and options, allowing users to customize the behavior of your CLI.
4. **File System Manipulation**: TypeScript provides built-in support for file system operations, allowing you to create, read, write, and manipulate files and directories as needed for your CLI projects.
5. **External APIs**: Connect to external APIs using libraries like `axios` to fetch data from the internet, making your CLI tools dynamic and data-driven.
6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling using TypeScript's exception handling or libraries like `try-catch-finally` to gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful error messages to users.
7. **Unit Testing**: Use testing frameworks like `Jest` or `Mocha` along with assertion libraries like `Chai` to ensure the reliability and stability of your CLI projects.
8. **Logging**: Implement a logging mechanism using libraries like `winston` to capture and store logs for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.
9. **Configuration Management**: Manage configuration settings using libraries like `dotenv` to keep sensitive information secure and allow users to customize your CLI's behavior via configuration files.
10. **Promises and Async/Await**: Leverage TypeScript's native support for Promises and Async/Await to handle asynchronous operations efficiently, such as making HTTP requests or reading files.
11. **Data Validation**: Use libraries like `validator` to validate user input and data, ensuring data integrity and security in your CLI applications.
12. **CLI Testing**: Employ CLI testing frameworks like `cypress` or `jest` with simulated user input to automate testing of your CLI projects.
13. **Documentation**: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for your CLI projects, including a well-structured README file, to help users understand how to use your tool effectively.
